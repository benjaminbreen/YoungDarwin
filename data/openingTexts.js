    text: `**Morning light breaks over the *HMS Beagle* as your rowboat grates onto the beach at the northern harbor of Post Office Bay on the Isla Floreana.** You step onto black volcanic rock, your boots crunching on brittle lava fragments. **Syms Covington**, your trusty assistant, stands at your side, though you plan to split up today to each cover different parts of the island. Nothing could be less inviting than the first appearance of this coast: a vast "broken field of black basaltic lava" twisted into rugged waves and riddled with fissures.

The air is stiflingly hot, as if the ground itself were a furnace – you wipe your brow, noting that the sun-baked rocks make the air *"feel close and sultry, like that from a stove"*. An acrid tang of sulphur and salt rides the breeze. Stunted grey-green shrubs dot the landscape, leafless and bone-dry. Their scant foliage gives off an unpleasant, bitter odor, making you wrinkle your nose.

You recall one of the *Beagle's* officers joking that this place looks like *"the cultivated parts of the Infernal Regions"* – a dark garden tended by fire.

You note a flash of movement among the rocks: a lava lizard skitters away, and overhead a hawk circles lazily. In this alien landscape, seemingly lifeless at first glance, you sense nature's secrets waiting to be uncovered.`

    title: 'Into the Equatorial Wilderness',
    text: `**The longboat scrapes against the volcanic shore of Post Office Bay as you leap nimbly onto Isla Floreana.** You adjust your wide-brimmed hat against the merciless equatorial sun beating down on this strange land. **Syms Covington**, your trusty assistant, stands at your side. Before you stretches a panorama of black lava fields, their surface *"broken up by innumerable craters"*.

A gentle wind carries the scent of salt and ash, mingling with the peculiar aroma of the stunted vegetation. Your boots sink slightly into the dark ashen soil as you survey the terrain with keen eyes. 

Your scientific instruments clink softly in your satchel. A mockingbird lands boldly on a nearby bush, studying you with a cocked head and fearless gaze. You smile at this welcome. *"The birds are strangers to Man,"* you think.

In the distance, the silhouette of a giant tortoise moves with prehistoric slowness against the horizon. Your pulse quickens. What next?`

    text: `**Landfall, at last.** The *H.M.S. Beagle* rocks gently at anchor in Stephens Bay as your boots touch the black volcanic beach of Post Office Bay on Isla Floreana. **Syms Covington**, your trusty (though on this morning, somewhat truculent) assistant, stands at your side. You stand transfixed, surveying the stark landscape sprawling before you. *"The fragments of Lava where most porous are reddish & like cinders,"* you murmur to yourself, jotting quick notes in your field book.

All around, leafless brushwood and low trees struggle against the harsh conditions, their branches twisted by wind and drought. Pausing to wipe sweat from your brow, you inhale deeply. The air carries a peculiar scent – volcanic minerals mingling with the salt spray and the unusual aroma of unfamiliar plants.

In the scrubland beyond, you spot movement – a group of small brown birds hopping fearlessly near a giant tortoise. The tortoise continues its slow grazing, unconcerned by your presence. Your scientific curiosity surges.

"Remarkable," you say to Syms, who seems nonplussed. "Utterly remarkable." What will you do next?`
